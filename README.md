# Cybersecurity Website
Website Creation for UAlbany Course Fall 2024

This is the website I created for a basic webdev course. The goal of this site was to create a dynamic website tailored to provide cybersecurity news/updates, tools, resources, and cyber hygiene advice.

This is a work in progress that I will add to over time. I am completing my degree so the bulk of this will happen as time allows but I would love to hear any feedback or advice since I am far from a web development pro.

Thanks for checking this out!

Website Creation for UAlbany CINF201 Course

Final project part I website creation aimed at developing a cybersecurity website tailored to provide cyber security news updates, tools, resources, and cyber hygiene advice.
The plan is to consolidate widely known tools and resources onto a website that will help point people in the right direction to explore cybersecurity resources.

This is a work in progress and will be a large project kept private for the time being.

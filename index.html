        <h1>Lets cover some key aspects of cybersecurity</h1>
        <p>Cybersecurity is a nuanced career field with highly complex and technical aspects making it challenging to get started.<br>Our goal is to remove barriers to accessing and finding incredible resources and information to keep you ahead of the threat actors.</p>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="flex-box">
                <h3>What is Cybersecurity?</h3>
                <p>"Cybersecurity is the art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. It seems that everything relies on computers and the internet now—communication (e.g., email, smartphones, tablets), entertainment (e.g., interactive video games, social media, apps ), transportation (e.g., navigation systems), shopping (e.g., online shopping, credit cards), medicine (e.g., medical equipment, medical records), and the list goes on. How much of your daily life relies on technology? How much of your personal information is stored either on your own computer, smartphone, tablet or on someone else's system?"<br>-from CISA</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-box">
                <h3>What are the risks of poor cybersecurity?</h3>
                <p>"There are many risks, some more serious than others. Among these dangers are malware erasing your entire system, an attacker breaking into your system and altering files, an attacker using your computer to attack others, or an attacker stealing your credit card information and making unauthorized purchases. There is no guarantee that even with the best precautions some of these things won't happen to you, but there are steps you can take to minimize the chances."<br>- from CISA</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-box">
                <h3>What can you do about it?</h3>
                <p>The best thing you can do whether you are a person interested in taking on the challenge of protecting your digital world, a business owner looking to revamp your cyber defense posture, or a professional looking to upskill, take a proactive approach by exploring what we have to offer. The best defense is one that is vastly informed and comprehensively educated on the lates tools and resources.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-box">
                <h3>Cybersecurity Challenges</h3>
                <p>Cybersecurity is an ever evolving field with a high learning curve. Threat actors challenge our individual digital privacy every day and people often underestimate the true impact of cyber threats. Because the cyber threat landscape is constantly evolving, it demands an incredible amount of vigilance and adaptation to stay ahead of the threat actors.</p>

    <h2>Penetration Testing Tools</h2>
    <p>Penetration testing, or ethical hacking, involves using a variety of tools to test and exploit vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and networks. Below are some of the most commonly used tools by penetration testers. These tools help simulate attacks and provide insights into system weaknesses, allowing security professionals to remediate them before malicious actors can exploit them.</p><br>

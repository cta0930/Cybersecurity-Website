        <h2>Cybersecurity Architecture Overview</h2>
        <p>
            A robust cybersecurity architecture is essential for protecting sensitive data, ensuring the availability and integrity of critical systems, and defending against emerging cyber threats. Below is a table that outlines key components of a well-rounded cybersecurity architecture, detailing their purpose and the crucial role they play in safeguarding systems.
        </p>

                    <td><strong>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR/XDR)</strong></td>
                    <td>
                        EDR provides continuous monitoring and response to advanced threats on endpoints (e.g., laptops, desktops), while XDR integrates data across multiple vectors (network, server, cloud, etc.) for a broader defense mechanism.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        EDR/XDR are essential for detecting sophisticated, persistent threats, allowing organizations to respond quickly before damage occurs. With XDR, security teams gain extended visibility across all critical areas of infrastructure.

                    <td>
                        IDS monitors network or system activities for malicious activities or violations of policies. IPS, on the other hand, detects and prevents intrusions by automatically taking action.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        IDS/IPS are crucial for detecting and blocking malicious activities in real-time, reducing the risk of exploitation and data breaches.

                    <td>
                        Encryption tools protect data at rest and in transit by converting sensitive information into unreadable code that can only be decrypted with the appropriate key.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        Encryption is vital in safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access, particularly when data is transmitted over insecure networks or stored in cloud environments.

                    <td>
                        By enforcing strict user authentication and authorization policies, IAM reduces the risk of insider threats and unauthorized access to sensitive systems.

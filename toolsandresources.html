                        EDR provides continuous monitoring and response to advanced threats that target various endpoints (e.g., laptops, desktops), while XDR integrates data across numerous vectors (network, server, cloud, etc.) for a more broad defense mechanism. Both of these are instrumental in creating a holistic defense mechanism that correlates dta from multiple security layers.

                    <td>
                        EDR/XDR are essential for detecting and responding to sophisticated, persistent threats, allowing organizations to quickly detect threats before damage occurs. With XDR, security teams gain an extended visibility across all critical areas of infrastructure within an organization.

                        Traditional antivirus software scans for known malware signatures and prevents unauthorized programs from executing on endpoints. Many more robust AV solutions include behavior analysis to pick up on unknown malware variants which are more challenging to address.

                        IAM controls user access to critical information and systems. It ensures that only authorized users have access to necessary data and systems, based on their roles. This is often associated with a Zero Trust Maturity Model ensuring appropriate access control mechanisms are in place and routinely audited for compliance.

                        By enforcing strict user authentication and authorization policies, IAM reduces the risk of insider threats and unauthorized access to sensitive systems. Insider threats are a growing concern across the cyber threat landscape in addition social engineering attacks where threat actors tirelesly attempt to steal valuable access credentials for additional cyber attacks.

                        SIEM systems collect, analyze, and correlate security data from across the infrastructure, providing real-time threat monitoring and generating alerts for security incidents. SOAR enhances SIEM by further automating and orchestrating security responses based on the data derived from SIEM systems. This streamlines incident response and reduces the time to respond effectively to cyber threats.

                        Together these technologies are vital to providing a comprehensive approach to security management. While SIEM provides the visibility and detection of threats, SOAR automates the remedation and response process, reducing manual effort. This cultivates a faster and more accurate overall response to incidents.
